Hello this is my second crypto project the first one I have forgotten what i want to do after a few month so now i just start up my new web 3 project 

🥩 Staking Protocol (Solidity)

A simple ERC-20 staking smart contract built with Solidity and Hardhat.
Users can stake tokens, earn time-based rewards, and claim rewards securely.

🚀 Features (Current)

✅ Stake ERC-20 tokens

✅ Earn rewards based on staking duration
